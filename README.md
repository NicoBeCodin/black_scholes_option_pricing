# black_scholes_option_pricing
Plots the changes in price of an option according to the Black-Scholes formula. 

Parameters are spot price (S), strike price (K), time to expriry (t), risk-free interest rate (r) and volatility (σ).

K range and σ range sliders allow for a wider variation of the strike and volatility in the plot.

Grid detail is the number of squares per line. Higher numbers take a bit more time to render.
